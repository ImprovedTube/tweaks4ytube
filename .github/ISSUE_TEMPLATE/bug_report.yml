        ## Before submitting:  Thanks for coming & caring! 
        Sometimes even 3 words are enough for a bug report.

        If so, you can add different/better words to that report.
        [GitHub's issue search](https://github.com/ImprovedTube/ImprovedTube/issues?q=) _(use the link or remove "is:issue is:open" from the search)_

           _If the status is "closed" (=fixed) recently, then the Browser's stores can be updated soon._  
           _If it was already closed months or years ago, then it might have appeared again and must be fixed again.)_
